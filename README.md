Intrusion Analysis and Threat Hunting with Open-Source Tools!

Powerful, flexible, and open source, the Suricata is far more than an IDS and IPS, it is a high-performance, open-source network analysis, and threat detection software!

It can be integrated and embedded within many commercial and open-source solutions and provides us with several features such as:

• Network Security Monitoring (NSM) ecosystem

• IDS / IPS

• Automatic Protocol Detection

• Lua Scripting

• Industry Standard Outputs

The good news is that this project and code are supported by the Open Information Security Foundation (OISF) which is committed to keeping Suricata open source forever!

• Source: https://suricata.io/

• Documentation: https://lnkd.in/gur47hrG

Oh wait, another good news, Josh Stroschein has a 3-hour YouTube practical talk on how to use this tool, dig deep into network traffic, deal with new forms of attack, and search for evidence of breaches: https://lnkd.in/g7Thj-jm
